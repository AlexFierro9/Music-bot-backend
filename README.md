# Music-bot-backend
Backend for Music-Bot

This is a the final backend for my Project Music-Bot.

[A demo is available here](https://github.com/AlexFierro9/Music-Bot-Demo) 

## How it works?
Leveraging Power of the Transformers library with Flask, this backend is a set of APIs that support user login (JWT authentication), registration with MongoDB Atlas for verification purposes.


## How to run it?

Go through main.py, replace the dummy values with required production values and voila!
OR
Use the docker image(still coming up with that, mainly dealyed due to hardware constraints)
